This project contains image captioning module using VGG-16 Model. 


The project can be divided into below parts:
1. DataSet Collection

We have used standard Flickr8K dataset. It Contains 8092 photographs in JPEG format.

Contains a five  descriptions for each photograph.

It has a pre-defined - training dataset(6,000 images), development dataset(1,000 images) and test dataset(1,000 images).


2. Feature Extraction

Features of each photograph is extracted using pre-trained VGG-16 model using Tensorflow and keras.


3. Developing a Model

We are going to train the Model on all of the photos & captions in the training dataset.
The model we will develop will generate a caption, given a photo as Input, and the caption will be generated one word at a time


4. Evaluating the Model

BLEU scores are used in text translation for evaluating translated text against one or more reference translations.
The BLEU metric scores a translation on a scale of 0 to 1, but is frequently displayed as a percentage value. 
The closer to 1, the more the translation correlates to a human translation
